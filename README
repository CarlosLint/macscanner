MacScanner is a software built to scan a C-class network to collect all
known MAC addresses. This is done by spawning a ping command (of which can
be replaced by any sort of command you might feel like using) just to
generate the ARP request.

After ping-sweeping the network, macscanner proceeds to query the kernel via
the "ip -s neighbour list" and processing the output to determine if the mac
addresses we are searching for are in the REACHABLE state.


This software will allow you to determine whether known mac adresses are
online or not and place send it to standard output (which will most likely
be redirected to a file and served by a webserver).

The code was made specifically to help people at ABC Makerspace to have a
way to publicly broadcast information on whether is there anyone at the
Makerspace's premises or not.

The code itself doesn't use any sort of libraries and only use standard
busybox-included Linux tools (I specifically avoided depending on nmap), so
you can easily compile it for embedded platforms like routers, cubieboards
and embedded Linuxes abroad.
